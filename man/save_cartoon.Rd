\title{Save fixed-size glycan cartoon image to local device.}
\usage{
save_cartoon(cartoon, filename, path = NULL, dpi = 300, border_px = 50)
}
\arguments{
\item{cartoon}{A ggplot2 object returned by \code{\link[=draw_cartoon]{draw_cartoon()}}.}

\item{filename}{File name of glycan cartoon.}

\item{path}{Path of the directory to save plot to:
path and filename are combined to create the fully qualified file name.
Defaults to the working directory.}

\item{dpi}{Dots per inch, default = 300.}

\item{border_px}{Width of the border around the image in pixels. Default 50.}

\description{
In theory, you can just use \code{ggplot2::ggsave()} to save the cartoons plotted by \code{\link[=draw_cartoon]{draw_cartoon()}}.
However, you can have trouble finding the best sizes for each cartoon
to make them look alike.
This function is designed to save the cartoons with self-adjusted sizes,
based on the size of the glycans,
so that when glycans with different sizes are put together, they will look alike.

\examples{
cartoon <- draw_cartoon("Gal(b1-3)GalNAc(a1-")
save_cartoon(cartoon, "p1.png", tempdir(), dpi = 300)
}
