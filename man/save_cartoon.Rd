\title{Save fixed-size glycan cartoon image to local device.}
\usage{
save_cartoon(cartoon, file, dpi = 300)
}
\arguments{
\item{cartoon}{A ggplot2 object returned by \code{\link[=draw_cartoon]{draw_cartoon()}}.}

\item{file}{File name of glycan cartoon.}

\item{dpi}{Dots per inch, default = 300.}
}
\description{
In theory, you can just use \code{ggplot2::ggsave()} to save the cartoons plotted by \code{\link[=draw_cartoon]{draw_cartoon()}}.
However, you can have trouble finding the best sizes for each cartoon
to make them look alike.
This function is designed to save the cartoons with self-adjusted sizes,
based on the size of the glycans,
so that when glycans with different sizes are put together, they will look alike.

\examples{
cartoon <- draw_cartoon("Gal(b1-3)GalNAc(a1-")
save_cartoon(cartoon, "p1.png", tempdir(),dpi = 300)
